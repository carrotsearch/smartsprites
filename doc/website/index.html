			<h1>What is SmartSprites?</h1>
      <p>
        SmartSprites will let you <strong>easily introduce and
        maintain <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sprites">CSS
        sprites</a> in your designs</strong>. SmartSprites parses special
        directives you can insert into your original CSS to mark individual
        images to be turned into sprites. It then builds sprite images from the
        collected images and automatically inserts the required CSS properties into
        your style sheet, so that the sprites are used instead of the
        individual images.
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, <strong>no tedious copying &amp; pasting to your
        CSS</strong> when adding, removing or changing sprited images. Just
        work with your CSS and original images as usual and have SmartSprites
        automatically transform them to the sprite-powered version when
        necessary.
      </p>

      <p>Other features of SmartSprites:</p>

			<h1>Using SmartSprites</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Start with preparing your design (HTML, CSS, images) the
          usual way.</strong> Use <tt>background-image</tt> to attach
          images like icons, logos or e.g. x- or y-repeated backgrounds. You'll
          probably end up with a CSS pattern along the lines of this:

          <code>#web {
  width: 17px; height: 17px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-image: url(../img/web.gif);
}

#logo {
  width: 50px; height: 50px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top right;
  background-image: url(../img/logo.png);
}

#main-box {
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
  background-position: 5px left;
  background-image: url(../img/top-frame.gif);
}</code>

          When you've verified that the original design works as indented, you're ready
          to annotate it with SmartSprite's directives.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Annotate your CSS with SmartSprites directives</strong>.
            SmartSprites directives must be enclosed between <tt>/**</tt> and
            <tt>*/</tt> characters (CSS comments), which will make them
            transparent to the browser, when you're working on your original
            CSS. Inside the comments, the directives follow the common CSS syntax of
            <tt>property: value</tt>. After adding annotations, the original CSS
            will look like this (directives highlighted):
          </p>

          <code><strong class="red">/** sprite: mysprite; sprite-image: url('../img/mysprite.png'); sprite-layout: vertical */</strong>
          
#web {
  width: 17px; height: 17px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-image: url(../img/web.gif); <strong>/** sprite-ref: mysprite; */</strong>
}

#logo {
  width: 50px; height: 50px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top right;
  background-image: url(../img/logo.png); <strong>/** sprite-ref: mysprite; sprite-alignment: right */</strong>
}

#main-box {
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
  background-position: 5px left;
  background-image: url(../img/top-frame.gif); <strong>/** sprite-ref: mysprite; sprite-alignment: repeat; <span class="nobreak"></span> 
                                                                                 sprite-margin-top: 5px */</strong>
}</code>

          <p>
            The first directive (in <span class="red">red</span>) tells
            SmartSprites that there will be one sprite whose name is
            <tt>mysprite</tt>, which should be saved to
            <tt>../img/mysprite.png</tt> relative to the CSS file. Images in
            this sprite will be laid out vertically (on top of each other).
          </p>

          <p>
            The directive for the <tt>#web</tt> rule instructs SmartSprites to
            add image located at <tt>../img/web.gif</tt> to the
            <tt>mysprite</tt> sprite. SmartSprites will also replace that line
            of CSS with properties referring to the sprite it created.
          </p>

          <p>
            The directive for the <tt>#logo</tt> rule tells SmartSprites to add
            <tt>../img/logo.png</tt> to the same sprite and align it to the
            right edge of the sprite image. This way, the image can be
            positioned towards the right edge of the box to achieve the same
            effect as with the original <tt>background-position: top right</tt>
            declaration.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, the directive for the <tt>#main-box</tt> rule instructs
            SmartSprites to repeat the <tt>../img/top-frame.png</tt> across
            the full width of the sprite image, so that the effect of
            <tt>background-repeat: repeat-x</tt> can be preserved.
            Additionally, SmartSprites will offset the image from the bottom
            edge of the neighbouring image in the sprite by 5px, so that the
            effect of <tt>background-position: 5px top</tt> is also preserved.
          </p>

          <p>
            Below is a detailed description of SmartSprites directives, which
            you may find a little heavy, but it will allow you to use all the power
            of SmartSprites. There are two types of SmartSprites directives:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Sprite Image Directive</strong>, marked in <span
                class="red">red</span>, is used to declare one sprite image,
                which merges some number of individual images. Sprite image
                directive must start with <tt>/** sprite:</tt> and must be
                contained in a single line. A single CSS file can contain any
                number of sprite image directives. The sprite image directive
                specifies the following properties:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Sprite ID</strong>, syntax: <tt>sprite:
                unique-id</tt>, required. A unique identifier by which the
                sprite image will be referred to. For each unique sprite id,
                SmartSprites will create one sprite image. </li>

                <li><strong>Sprite image location</strong>, syntax:
                <tt>sprite-image: url('path/name.(png | gif | jpg)')</tt>,
                required.  CSS file-relative path to the sprite image to be
                created.  SmartSprites will infer the format of the image
                based on the extension used.  Currently supported are:
                gif, png and jpg.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Sprite image layout</strong>, syntax:
                <tt>sprite-layout: vertical | horizontal</tt>, optional,
                default value: <tt>horizontal</tt>. Specifies whether the
                individual images should be laid out in the sprite image
                vertically (on top of each other) or horizontally (next to
                each other).
                </li>

                <li><a name="sprite-matte-color"><strong>Matte
                color</strong></a>, syntax: <tt>sprite-matte-color:
                #ff8822</tt>, optional, default value: <tt>#ffffff</tt>.
                Specifies the matte color that should be used to render partial
                transparencies on sprites saved in GIF or PNG8 formats. Note:
                currently only the 6-digit hexadecimal color specifications are
                supported.  See also the <a href="#png-depth">PNG color
                depth</a> and <a href="#png-ie6">IE6-friendly PNG</a> options.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>IE6 compatibility mode</strong>, syntax: <tt>sprite-ie6-mode:
                  auto | none</tt>, optional, default value: <tt>auto</tt>.
                  Specifies whether an IE6-compatible image for this sprite should be generated
                  when necessary (<tt>auto</tt>) or should not be generated at all
                  (<tt>none</tt>). See the <a href="#png-ie6">IE6-friendly PNG</a> option for
                  more details.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <a name="sprite-image-uid"><strong>Sprite UID generation</strong></a>, 
                  syntax: <tt>sprite-image-uid: none | md5 | date</tt>, optional, default value: <tt>none</tt>.
                  Specifies the type of UID (identifier) to append to sprite image URL references 
                  in the generated CSS, useful when sprite images are served with
                  <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#expires">far future Expires headers</a>.
                  The following UID types are supported:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <tt>none</tt>: no UID suffix will be appended (default)
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                      <tt>md5</tt>: UID will be a MD5 hash of the sprite image. This type 
                      of UID will change only if the content of the sprite image changes.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                      <tt>date</tt>: UID will be a timestamp taken at the time of sprite 
                      image generation. This type of UID will be different every time SmartSprites processing
                      is run, even if the sprite images do not change.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  UIDs will appended at the end of sprite image URL after a '?' character, e.g:
                  <code>background-image: url('../img/logo.png?d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e')</code>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Sprite Reference Directive</strong>, marked in <span
              class="orange">orange</span>, is used to tell SmartSprites that
              a specific individual image should be placed in the specified
              sprite image. The sprite reference directive must contain
              <strong>in one line</strong>, a <tt>background-image</tt> CSS
              property specifying a CSS file-relative path to the individual
              image and a CSS comment starting with <tt>/** sprite-ref:
              </tt>. The sprite reference directive specifies the following
              properties:

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Sprite Reference</strong>, syntax:
                <tt>sprite-ref: sprite-id</tt>, required. A reference to one
                of the sprites declared by the sprite image directives.
                The individual image will be placed in the sprite with the
                provided identifier.</li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Sprite Alignment</strong>, syntax:
                    <tt>sprite-alignment: left | right | top | bottom |
                    repeat</tt>, optional, default value: <tt>left</tt> for
                    sprites with vertical layout, <tt>top</tt> for sprites
                    with horizontal layout. Defines the edge of the sprite
                    image to which this individual image will be aligned. For
                    vertically aligned sprites, the allowed values are
                    <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt>, while for horizontally
                    aligned ones -- <tt>top</tt> and <tt>bottom</tt>.  Sprite
                    alignment can come in handy when the original background
                    image was positioned towards the right or bottom of the
                    box (e.g. <tt>background-position: top right</tt>).
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    One special alignment value is <tt>repeat</tt>. In this
                    case, the contents of the individual image will be
                    repeated across the whole width of a vertical sprite or
                    the whole height of a horizontal sprite. This will
                    allow you to use sprites for backgrounds that have
                    <tt>background-repeat</tt> set to <tt>repeat-x</tt> or
                    <tt>repeat-y</tt>. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Warning</strong>: the width (height) of the
                    resulting sprite will be not smaller than the least
                    common multiple of the widths of all individual images
                    with alignment set to <tt>repeat</tt> in that vertical
                    (horizontal) sprite. For example, if you have "repeated"
                    individual images of widths (heights) 3px, 5px, 7px and
                    11px in one vertical (horizontal) sprite, the width
                    (height) of that sprite will be 1155px. Therefore, use
                    <tt>sprite-alignment: repeat</tt> with caution.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Sprite margins</strong>, syntax:
                <tt>sprite-margin-(left | right | top | bottom):
                OFFSETpx</tt>, optional, default value: <tt>0px</tt>. The
                offset of this image from the left, right, top and bottom
                edge or the neighbouring image in the sprite. This property
                may be useful when the original image was not positioned
                exactly on the edge of the box, but had e.g.
                <tt>background-position: 5px left</tt>. Note: only pixel
                values are allowed. Shorthand version of margins property

          <p>
            When you've finished annotating your CSS with SmartSprites
            directives, you can have SmartSprites generate the sprite images
            and modified CSS files for you. Before you do that, you will need
            to install some software SmartSprites requires and SmartSprites
            itself.

              <p>
                If you notice any line containing a warning (<tt>WARN:</tt>),
                please read it carefully and correct the problem. Otherwise,
                your design may not look like the original version.
              </p>

              <p>
                Upon successful completion, SmartSprites will create all the
                sprite images in the locations specified by the sprite image
                directives. Also, next to each processed CSS file,
                SmartSprites will create a corresponding CSS file with a
                <tt>-sprite</tt> suffix. The original CSS files will remain
                unchanged. To switch your design to CSS sprites, link these
                CSS files instead of the original ones in your HTML.
              </p>

              <p>
                For our example, the generated CSS would look similar to this:
              </p>

              <code>#web { 
  width: 17px; height: 17px; 
  background-repeat: no-repeat; 
  background-image: url('../img/mysprite.png');
  background-position: left -0px;
} 

#logo { 
  width: 50px; height: 50px; 
  background-repeat: no-repeat; 
  background-position: top right; 
  background-image: url('../img/mysprite.png');
  background-position: right -17px;
} 

#main-box { 
  background-repeat: repeat-x; 
  background-position: 5px left; 
  background-image: url('../img/mysprite.png');
  background-position: left -64px;
}</code>

              <p>
                Notice that all of the SmartSprites directives have been
                omitted in the generated CSS file. If you still see any of
                them in the output file, it means these specific directives
                had some syntactic or semantic errors and have been ignored.
                Warning messages should help you to pinpoint the problems.
              </p>

              <p>
                Also notice that SmartSprites currently doesn't remove the
                original <tt>background-position</tt> properties, but appends
                its own ones below to shadow them. Your design may break if
                you have <tt>background-position</tt> or
                <tt>background-image</tt> properties appearing
                <strong>below</strong> the line with SmartSprite's sprite
                reference directive.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Check if your design still looks the same</strong>. Chances
          are, it won't right away. See <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> for some tips.
        </li>

        <li>
          <a name="global-options"><strong>Tune global options</strong></a>.
          SmartSprites has a number of additional options you can specify
          in the command line invocation to further tune your designs. 

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>--output-dir-path</strong>: output directory for
              processed CSS files and CSS-relative sprite images, optional, default: not specified.
              <p>
                If <tt>root-dir-path</tt> is provided, the directory structure
                relative to <tt>root-dir-path</tt> will be preserved in the
                output directory. E.g. if CSS files are contained in the
                <tt>css/base directory</tt> of <tt>root-dir-path</tt>, the
                processed results will be written to
                <tt>output-dir-path/css/base</tt>. Also, CSS-relative sprite
                images will be written to the output directory. Sprite images
                with document-root-relative URLs will be written relative to
                the <tt>--document-root-dir-path</tt>. If the
                <tt>output-dir-path</tt> directory does not exist, it will be
                created.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can leave this property empty, in which case the CSS
                files will be written next to the original CSS files with
                <tt>css-file-suffix</tt>, and sprite images will be written relative
                to CSS files.  If you are using a non-empty <tt>output-dir-path</tt>,
                you might want to use an empty <tt>css-file-suffix</tt>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>--document-root-dir-path</strong>: Document root path for
              document-root-relative (starting with <tt>/</tt>) image urls in
              CSS, optional, default: not specified.

              <p>
                All document-root-relative image and sprite URLs will be taken relative to
                <tt>document-root-dir-path</tt>. Also document-root-relative
                sprite URLs will be written relative to
                <tt>document-root-dir-path</tt>.  You can leave this property
                empty if your CSS uses only CSS-relative image URLs.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>--log-level</strong>: Message logging level, optional, default: <tt>INFO</tt>.

              <p>
                Messages less important than <tt>log-level</tt> will not be shown. SmartSprites
                has 3 levels of log messages (in the increasing order of importance):
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li><strong>INFO</strong>: information messages, can be safely ignored</li>
                <li><strong>IE6NOTICE</strong>: notices related to possible quality loss when creating IE6-friendly sprite images, see also the <a href="png-ie6">IE6-friendly PNG</a> option</li>
                <li><strong>WARN</strong>: warnings related to syntax, IO and sprite rendering quality loss problems that may cause the converted sprite-based designs look broken</li>
              </ol>

                  colors, PNG8 will be used.  Otherwise, the sprite will be
                  saved in PNG24.
                </li>

                <li>

                  the PNG8 format.  If the sprite image contains partial
                  transparencies (alpha channel) or has more than 255 colors,
                  image quality loss may occur and appropriate warnings will be
                  issued.  See also the <a

                generate a corresponding color-reduced PNG8 file for IE6. An extra IE6-only
                CSS rule will be added to the generated CSS file to ensure that IE6 (and only IE6)
                uses the color-reduced version:

          <strong>Integrate SmartSprites with your build scripts.</strong> SmartSprites comes
          with an Ant that performs sprite processing and has exactly the
          same options as the command line invocation. For an example invocation

      <a name="faq"></a>
			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>After conversion to sprites, my design doesn't resemble the
            original at all. What's wrong?</strong>.  This may happen :-) First
            of all, check for SmartSprites warning messages, these indicate
            that some of the directives have been ignored due to syntactic or
            semantic errors. Before further investigation, make sure you don't
            get any warnings.
          </p>

          <p>
            Secondly, make sure each SmartSprites directive fits entirely
            in one line, including the <tt>*/</tt> sequence closing the
            comment. Otherwise, you may get unpredictable results.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thirdly, as shown in the previous section, SmartSprites for the
            time being doesn't remove the original <tt>background-position</tt>
            properties, but appends its own ones below to shadow them. Your
            design may break if you have <tt>background-position</tt> or
            <tt>background-image</tt> properties appearing
            <strong>below</strong> the line with SmartSprite's sprite reference
            directive. SmartSprites outputs a warning in such cases. If this
            happens, move the overriding properties <strong>before</strong> the
            sprite reference directive in your original CSS file and run
            SmartSprites again.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Other images from the sprite "show through" at places.
            Why?</strong>.  This can happen when the box you applied a sprited
            image to is larger than the sprited image itself. In this
            situation, other images in the sprite that are below or to the
            right of it will also be visible. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To fix this you can size the box to make its dimensions equal
            to the dimensions of the image. If this is impossible, use
            sprite margins (e.g. <tt>sprite-margin-bottom</tt>) to create
            some empty space around the image in the sprite, so that the
            other images below it (or right of it) don't show through.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Repeating images in sprites doesn't work. Is it a
          bug?</strong>.  Remember that images repeated horizontally
          (<tt>background-repeat: repeat-x</tt>) must be added to a vertically
          laid out sprite (<tt>sprite-layout: vertical</tt>), and images
          repeated vertically (<tt>background-repeat: repeat-y</tt>) must be in
          a horizontally laid out sprite (<tt>sprite-layout: horizontal</tt>).
          There is no way they can work otherwise, hence two sprite image
          layouts in SmartSprites.
        </li>
       
        <li>
          <strong>Is there any bigger example of using SmartsSprites I can take
          a look at?</strong> Yes, look in the <tt>test/ real-world-example</tt>
          directory of the distribution. This is the original design I was
          working on when I came up with the idea of SmartSprites.
